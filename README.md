# Introduction

Welcome to this Javascript training.

This project will be decomposed into steps, each step aiming to learn you something new around HTML/JS/CSS.

For every step you can checkout the branch with the corresponding name to get to the base of the exercice. Each step will have a set of instructions for you to complete in order to learn.

# Steps

Here are the list of steps available, and what they are focusing on.

* Step 0 - RequireJS setup

# How to do this training yourself

To do this training yourself, it is advised you:
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Checkout the step you want to work on
- Read the instructions.md file to know what should be done
- Do it! I think nothing is better to learn than trying it yourself
- Commit your changes
- Ask anyone to review your code! Improving comes with accepting criticism

# Feedback

Please (pretty please) let me know if you find any error or any possible improvement to this training. I'm starting it as a side project to help a friend but would love to have many people using it.
